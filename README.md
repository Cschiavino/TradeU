# TradeU  

TradeU is a Marketplace where students can discover resources, buy and sell gently used items.  

We all have things we don’t use, never used, or simply outgrew. But these treasured items still have value. TradeU provides is a great way to make exchanging items easier.  

Say goodbye to the things you’re no longer using and hello to delightful new finds.
